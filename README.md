# VERTA

### Automated 3D Vertical Property Mapping from 2D Building Plans

> A hackathon prototype for transforming conventional 2D building plans into structured, validated, and uniquely identifiable 3D property units.

**Theme:** Urban Planning
**Event:** 24-Hour Independent Hackathon
**Project Status:** Hackathon Prototype

---

## Overview

Traditional property records primarily represent land in two dimensions.

However, modern buildings contain multiple vertically stacked property units:

* Apartments
* Offices
* Commercial units
* Basements
* Other independently identifiable spaces

A conventional 2D parcel boundary cannot adequately represent these vertically separated property units.

**3D ULPIN** addresses this problem by converting a 2D building/floor plan into a structured 3D representation of individual property units.

```

---

# Problem

A traditional 2D property representation can describe:

```text
Where the property is
```

but has difficulty representing:

```text
Which property unit exists
on which floor
at which vertical elevation.
```

For example, a single building may contain:

```text
Floor 3 → Apartment A
Floor 2 → Apartment B
Floor 1 → Apartment C
Ground  → Commercial Unit
Basement → Parking / Storage
```

All of these may occupy the same parent parcel while representing different vertical spaces.

The project demonstrates a way to represent these spaces as structured 3D property units.

---

# Solution

3D ULPIN takes a 2D floor plan and converts it into a vertically structured property model.

The prototype performs:

1. Floor-plan processing
2. Unit-boundary extraction
3. Polygon generation
4. Floor assignment
5. Geometry validation
6. Prototype property identifier generation
7. 3D extrusion
8. Interactive visualization

The architecture is designed so that synthetic/representative inputs can be used during the hackathon while allowing real-world GIS and cadastral data sources to be integrated later.

---

# Key Features

## 2D Floor Plan Processing

The system accepts representative architectural floor plans and extracts candidate enclosed regions using computer-vision techniques.

The prototype primarily uses classical computer vision rather than training a custom deep-learning model.

---

## 2D Property Unit Mapping

Detected regions are converted into structured polygons.

Each unit receives spatial metadata such as:

* Unit ID
* Floor number
* Unit type
* Polygon
* Area

---

## 3D Property Representation

Each 2D polygon is converted into a 3D prism.

Example:

```text
Floor 2

Base Z = 3m
Top Z  = 6m
```

This produces a vertically positioned property volume.

---

## Basement Support

Underground properties are represented using negative Z coordinates.

```text
Ground Floor
0m → +3m

Basement 1
-3m → 0m

Basement 2
-6m → -3m
```

This allows above-ground and underground units to coexist within the same spatial model.

---

## ULPIN-Style Property Identifier

Each unit receives a deterministic prototype identifier.

Example:

```text
PARCEL-001-B01-F02-U03
```

The identifier maintains a relationship between:

```text
Parcel
  ↓
Building
  ↓
Floor
  ↓
Unit
```

### Important

This is a **ULPIN-style prototype identifier** created for the hackathon.

It is **not an official government ULPIN implementation** and does not claim compatibility with an official cadastral registry.

---

## Geometry Validation

The system validates generated property geometry for:

* Invalid polygons
* Overlapping units
* Units outside the parcel/building
* Unassigned building area
* Duplicate geometries

Example:

```text
Building Area
      -
Assigned Unit Area
      =
Unassigned Area
```

---

## Interactive 3D Visualization

The frontend provides a 3D representation of the generated property structure.

Users can inspect:

* Floors
* Individual units
* Basement levels
* Property identifiers
* Geometry validation status

---

# Synthetic Data

The prototype intentionally uses representative/synthetic data.

The hackathon does not depend on:

* Real cadastral datasets
* Government property databases
* Real GNSS/CORS data
* Real LiDAR datasets
* Drone surveys

The synthetic dataset provides a reliable demonstration path.

This also ensures that the project can run locally without external data dependencies.

---

# Fallback Architecture

A major design requirement is demo reliability.

The system supports:

```text
             Floor Plan
                 │
                 ▼
            CV Pipeline
                 │
           ┌─────┴─────┐
           │           │
        Success      Failure
           │           │
           ▼           ▼
       CV Output   Synthetic Data
           │           │
           └─────┬─────┘
                 ▼
          Common Backend
                 │
                 ▼
            Validation
                 │
                 ▼
          ULPIN-style ID
                 │
                 ▼
             Extrusion
                 │
                 ▼
              3D View
```

Therefore, a CV failure does not prevent the complete application from being demonstrated.

# Validation

The system checks:

### Geometry

```text
Is the polygon valid?
```

### Containment

```text
Is the unit inside the building/parcel?
```

### Overlap

```text
Does the unit overlap another unit on the same floor?
```

### Coverage

```text
Is significant building area unassigned?
```

### Duplicates

```text
Are two units geometrically identical or nearly identical?
```

---

# Example Unit

A generated unit may look like:

```json
{
  "unit_id": "unit_001",
  "ulpin": "PARCEL-001-B01-F02-U03",
  "floor_number": 2,
  "unit_type": "residential",
  "area": 1200,
  "base_z": 3,
  "top_z": 6,
  "geometry_3d": {
    "vertices": [],
    "faces": []
  }
}
```

---

# Design Philosophy

The project intentionally follows a practical hackathon architecture.

### Simple

Avoid unnecessary infrastructure.

### Explainable

Use understandable CV and geometry operations.

### Modular

Separate CV, GIS, backend, and visualization.

### Deterministic

Synthetic data and identifier generation should be reproducible.

### Reliable

Maintain a fallback demonstration path.

### Extensible

Allow future integration with real-world geospatial sources.

---
